Please follow these steps to set up PIN:

1. Download and uncompress Pin 3.6 for Linux on a Linux machine. I have tested this for ubuntu.
Website: https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-binary-instrumentation-tool-downloads

2. Pin comes with a large number of example tools placed in directory pin-3.6-97554-g31f0a167d-gcc-linux/source/tools/.
You can take a look at them. Most of the examples discussed in the class are taken for the ManualExamples directory.
Create a directory for your own work under pin-3.6-97554-g31f0a167d-gcc-linux/source/tools/. Let us call it CS622.

3. Place all example files from course homepage in the CS622 directory. Also, place makefile and makefile.rules here.

4. Change directory to CS622.

5. To build a tool, use the following command (replace mypintool by the name of the Pin tool file):

make obj-intel64/mypintool.so

6. To run pin with the tool attached, use the following command (replace executable by the path of the binary you want to instrument):

../../../pin -t obj-intel64/mypintool.so -- executable

7. Compile pthread.c using the following command:

gcc -O3 -static -pthread pthread.c -o pthread

8. To test inscount_detach tool, do the following:

a. Change directory to CS622 and launch a web browser from the command line e.g., you can invoke firefox

b. Find out the PID of the browser process through the `ps' command e.g., ps -f -U yourloginname. Suppose it is nnnn.

c. From another terminal, launch pin: ../../../pin -pid nnnn -t obj-intel64/inscount_detach.so
